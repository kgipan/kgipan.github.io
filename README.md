<h1> How to Create a Website in GitHub</h1>
Interested in learning how to create a website in Github? Follow these simple instructions and you will have one in no time! In the example we will use below, we will have a simple webpage with a photo of yourself and your name at the top.<br> 
1. To start, you will want to create an account on http://github.com<br>

2. Once you have a GitHub account, login to your account. At the top right of your screen you will see a down arrow click that for a drop down menu and select "Your repositories"<br>

3. Click the green button on the right side "New"<br>

4. In the text box provided, type the name you would like for the respository. In this example, we will use your GitHub username.github.io. Mine is kgipan.github.io<br>
Click the green button on the bottom "Create repository"<br>
5. Click on "Upload existing file".<br> 
6. Now open your editor. We will use Visual Studio Code. When you open the VS Code, choose "New File"<br>

7. Now you will want to click on the top right on "Explorer" which looks like two pages ontop of eachother and then click "Open Folder"<br>

Your finder will pop up, choose a folder in which you would like to work from. If you do not have one, open a new Finder Window and create a folder. In the example below, the folder I used is "GitHub", but feel free to name your folder anything you would like!<br>
8. Now that you have your folder "GitHub" on Visual Studio Code, you will want to click "New File" next to your folder name. The icon appears next to your folder name and looks like a page with a "+" on the bottom right. Then name the file you just created "index.html"<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89999452/132097112-0bc053a1-3858-409f-9835-4e7d9cea76a1.png"/><br>
9. In Finder, locate a photo of yourself and drag the file into the left margin of the Visual Studio Code in the same directory as your newly created index.html file. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89999452/132097588-850b825d-ea52-4ca9-abcb-06fc651fa88d.png"/><br>
10. Click on your "index.html" file. And type in the following code: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89999452/132097809-dbbc143b-df95-495d-80cb-bfc3ad7c389f.png"/> Instead of "Your Name" you will want to type your own name.<br>
11. Now go back to your GitHub page where you should have a drag and drop pulled up. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89999452/132096198-2bf6550e-886a-451e-a067-961f03b81d5b.png"/><br>
12. Refer back to step 7 and recall the folder in which you chose to use in Visual Studio Code. In the example, my folder was "GitHub". Now open your Finder and locate the folder in which you used, and drag and drop those files (the index.html and the image file) into GitHub.<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89999452/132098177-ebb84ffe-bf73-46ca-8828-776709624b62.png"/><br>
 <h2>You're Almost There!</h2><br>
 13. Now you need to commit your changes! Just scroll down and click the green button "Commit changes" <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89999452/132098265-4aa31890-7221-4f3d-8d74-ef47fa8e4936.png"/><br>
 14. Now refer back to step 4 in which you named your repository. You will want to open a new browser and type in your repository name to test it and make sure you wrote the code correctly. In my example, I would type https://kgipan.github.io/ <br>
You should have a photo of yourself with the header of Your Name Webpage!<br>
<h1>Well Done!!</h1>
